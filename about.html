          <p class="card-text text-black">“The Nevada Cyber Club students, using the concept of a cyber teaching hospital as the organizing principle, are initially focusing on the problem of individual cyberhygiene. Just as washing your hands is good hygiene, certain cyber practices help protect against cyber problems. Improving cyberhygiene, just like washing hands, is good for the individual and the community. Researching good cybersecurity practices to develop cyber clinic guidance, then training to deliver the approved guidance to individuals in a cyber clinic setting provides students with an immersive learning experience. The purpose is clear: Develop student expertise, so they can help individuals and organizations improve their cybersecurity through improving cyberhygiene.” ~ James Elste, Faculty Advisor, Nevada Cyber Club</p>

          <p class="card-text text-black">“It is important to know the security of the device one is using. If it’s a smartphone, for example, it should have a password to gain access and the privacy features should be turned on. Also, one should be aware of the vulnerable information they are inputting into a device, such as Social Security number, driver’s license or bank account numbers, and know whether the software they are downloading, such as all those smartphone apps, is secure.” ~ Joan Patterson<br><br>

          James Elste emphasized that it all boils down to being “educated and aware.”<br><br>
